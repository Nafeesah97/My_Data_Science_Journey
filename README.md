Hello there! I'm not your typical data scientist. With a background in Optometry and Vision Science, I bring a unique perspective to the world of data science. My passion lies in harnessing the power of data to drive positive change in the healthcare sector and various other vital industries.

## My Journey So Far
- **Current Role**: I'm currently making waves as an intern at PrognosAI, where I'm actively contributing to data-driven solutions.
- **Continuous Learning**: I'm hungry for knowledge and growth. That's why I'm enrolled in the prestigious OneCampus Data Science Program. But that's not all â€“ I'm also honing my software engineering skills through the ALX Software Engineering Program.
- **Programming Skills**: I speak the languages of technology fluently, including C, Python, R, and SQL. Data manipulation and analysis are second nature to me.
- **Visualization Whiz**: I'm adept at turning raw data into insights that tell compelling stories. My tools of choice? Tableau and spreadsheets, of course.
## What Drives Me
My mission is to leverage my diverse skill set and background to enhance the healthcare industry and contribute to solving the world's most pressing challenges. I'm excited about the limitless possibilities that data science offers, and I'm always eager to collaborate on projects that make a real impact.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

### [Simple Calculator Using Python](https://github.com/Nafeesah97/My_Data_Science_Journey/tree/main/Calculator_project)

- Description: This was to build a calculator that performs basic operations.
- Technologies Python.
- Highlights: It asks the users for their names, and asks them to input the values and operations they want it to perform.

### [Project Name 2](link-to-project-2)

- Description: A brief description of what this project is about.
- Technologies Used: List the tools, libraries, and languages used.
- Highlights: Mention any notable achievements or insights from this project.

### [Stroke Predictor](stroke_prediction_project/stroke_prediction.ipynb)
- Description: This was to test which model better predicts the likelihood of a subject having stroke.
- Technologies Used: Python.
- Highlights: Overall, I concluded that the cross-validation model was more accurate than the train_test_split model.

Here are some of the skills and technologies I've been working with:

- Data Analysis
- Machine Learning
- Data Visualization
- Python
- SQL
- Pandas
