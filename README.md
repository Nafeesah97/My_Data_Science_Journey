# My Data Journey

Welcome to my data portfolio! I'm Salaudeen Naffisat, a data science enthusiast with a passion for exploring and analyzing data to derive meaningful insights. This repository showcases my journey, projects, and skills as I build expertise in data science with a focus on healthcare, business, and government.

## About Me

- **Name**: Salaudeen Naffisat Ajoke  
- **LinkedIn**: [My LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/naffisat-salaudeen-74ba60240/)  
- **Email**: salaudeennafeesah97@gmail.com  
- **GitHub**: [My GitHub Profile](https://github.com/Nafeesah97)  

With a background in Optometry and Vision Science, I bring a unique perspective to data science. Iâ€™m passionate about using data to drive solutions in public health, improve decision-making in business, and inform government policies.

## My Journey So Far

- **ðŸŽ“ Current Focus**: I'm currently pursuing a Master of Public Health (MPH), where I'm building strong expertise in epidemiology, biostatistics, and evidence-based decision-making. This intentional career pause is helping me develop a sharp analytical mindset and a solid technical foundation to support data-informed solutions across public health, business, and government sectors.  
- **ðŸ“š Continuous Growth**: I completed the OneCampus Data Analysis Program, where I worked on real-world projects involving data analysis, visualization, and actionable insight generation. This experience equipped me to translate complex data into strategies that drive meaningful impact in diverse fields.
- **Programming**: Proficient in Python, R, SQL, and C for data analysis, model building, and automation.  
- **Visualization**: Skilled in presenting insights using Tableau, PowerBI, Excel, and Python libraries.

## What Drives Me

My mission is to leverage data to improve livesâ€”especially in the healthcare, public sector, and business environments. I'm eager to collaborate on impactful projects that use data for good.

## Projects

### [ðŸ§® Simple Calculator Using Python](https://github.com/Nafeesah97/My_Data_Science_Journey/tree/main/Calculator_project)

- **Description**: A Python script that performs basic arithmetic operations.
- **Technologies**: Python.
- **Highlights**: User-interactive script that personalizes the experience by asking for names and inputs.

### [ðŸ§  Stroke Prediction Model](stroke_prediction_project/stroke_prediction.ipynb)

- **Description**: A machine learning project to predict stroke risk.
- **Technologies**: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas.
- **Highlights**: Compared model accuracy using cross-validation and train_test_split; cross-validation performed better.

### [No-Show Appointments Analysis](No_Show)

- **Description**: This project analyzes over 110,000 medical appointment records in Brazil to uncover insights into patient attendance behavior. The dataset tracks whether patients showed up for their scheduled medical appointments, including variables like age, gender, neighborhood, chronic conditions, and reminders.

- **Technologies Used**: SQL
- **Highlights**: The analysis highlights important factors linked to patient no-shows:
- Younger age groups (especially teens and young adults) are more likely to miss appointments.
- SMS reminders, surprisingly, show **higher** no-show ratesâ€”likely a selection bias.
- Certain neighborhoods and chronic conditions may correlate with higher attendance issues.
- Wait time plays a major role: longer delays between scheduling and appointments increase no-shows.

## Skills & Tools

- **Languages**: Python, R, SQL, C  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib  
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Tableau, Excel  
- **Domains**: Data Analysis, Machine Learning, Data Visualization, Deep Learning, Computer Vision
